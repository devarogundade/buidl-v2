# Buidl - Create NFTs Collection that Works On Across Multiple Chains With Zero Knowledge
## _A Moralis X Google Cloud Hackathon Project_

Buidl is a Social-Fi for video content creators (e.g instructors, YouTubers, DIY makers, etc) anyone that shares their skills with other people online either for free or at a particular cost.

Today, there are various existing Web2 solutions for this particular aspect, but we are taking it further leveraging blockchain technology to provide more secured, learning incentives with ownership to the community pattern.

To become a creator on the buidl platform requires a minimum stake of 2000 BDL tokens for a minimum duration of one year, if staking is withdrawn after one year the user is not a creator anymore until they restake a minimum of 2000 BDL back in the contract.
A creator with suspicious activities and a high report rate is subjected to ban and their staked BDL token remains locked in the smart contract, this feature helps us maintain the DAO a safe community.

## Core Features
- # Incentives for learning
    Non creators will cover the largest base of the platform, it is a crucial part of the platform to encourage and reward users to retain them to use and enjoy the       platform.

    
- # Cryptocurrency payment and Guaranteed refund system using Staking protocol
    The Buidl Token (BDL)  is the only payment method of the platform, which will be available on CEX and DEX.

- # Account Bound Certificate (ERC4973)
    The Buidl Token (BDL)  is the only payment method of the platform, which will be available on CEX and DEX.

- # Protection on premium contents
    A better approach to protect videos online is creating custom players to restrict access by other players, this is very common in streaming services like netflix,     etc.
